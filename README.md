# Homework Project Overview
This repository contains the first significant homework project I completed during my Web Development courses at Kauno Informacinių Technologijų Mokykla. The project serves as a test of my HTML and CSS skills, with a particular focus on responsive design using flexbox. As part of the assignment, I was tasked with recreating the design of a website provided by the instructor.

## The Task
The task strictly required the use of HTML and CSS only to recreate the design of the instructor's website. It was also not possible to use any features we hadn't yet learned like transitions, animations or grid.
Due to the nature of the assignment, which involved the instructor's personal work, I am unable to provide links or screenshots of the original page. However, for reference, I have included wireframes of the layout in the "task-layout-wireframes" folder within this repository.
